# Todo-CLI 
A cross-platform CLI that manages daily tasks for you. You can manage your daily tasks with commands under the command line. All of this is because I believe I needed a Todo app, but in a major ridiculous way, it ended up taking up more of my time than helping me manage my time. I recommend this software to you, a prolific programmer, it is not time-consuming and does not have additional features without use. It helps you to understand exactly what you need to do in your code in the next few hours.
